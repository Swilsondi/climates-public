# 🌎 CLIMATES — Connect. Create. Collaborate.

A modern day collaboration platform helping small and big creators locally collaborate.

Climates is a full-stack platform that helps **artists, producers, engineers, and creatives** discover and collaborate with one another through an engaging, media-driven experience. Users can swipe to connect, chat with collaborators, share creative work, and explore a location-based network — all powered by a scalable, real-time backend and a polished frontend UI.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of Climates is to bring together **creative professionals and talent** in a meaningful, interactive way — whether they’re across the street or across the world. This is not a social network — it's a **collaboration engine**, designed for:

- Musicians looking for engineers
- Designers looking for visual inspiration
- Streamers looking for partners
- Anyone with a skill looking to connect and _create something real_

## 🧠 What I Built

This project is one of my personal full-stack applications, architected to scale and supports real users, rich media, and real-time collaboration logic. It includes:

### ✅ Fully Custom Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

- Secure **user authentication** (JWT, password hashing)
- Flexible **user profiles** with embedded skills, social links, media, and geographic location
- Scalable **media upload pipeline** (using AWS S3)
- A robust **collaboration system** (swipe-to-match logic)
- Real-time **chat messaging system** with unlimited messages and optional media attachments
- A **feed and profile post system** to share creative work
- Geo-filtered **search and discovery** capabilities
- **Map visualization** of collaborators using location data
- Future-ready structure with API versioning, modular architecture, and middleware

### ⚛️ Frontend (React)

- Responsive design
- Swipe interface for discovery
- Vertical media feed inspired by modern short-form content platforms
- Integrated map to explore collaborators visually
- Seamless chat interface with media preview
